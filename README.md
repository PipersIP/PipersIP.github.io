There are four types of cards on desktops:

	1. Flip: Like a playing card - it has a front face and a back face. Clicking flips it over.
		Relies on flip.js (which calls modal.js) and flip.css

	2. Flap: Like a calendar - it has three faces; a cover & two inside pages. But the cover opens *upwards*.
		Relies on flap.js (which calls modal.js) and flap.css

	3. Book: Like a book - also has three faces; a cover & two inside pages. This opens *sidewards*, like turning a page.

	4. Static: Like a poster - it has one face. Clicking doesn't do anything.

On mobile screens, all of these are displayed as static modals. No exciting clicking. 

I am currently in the process of re-writing this application. *Third-attempy.html is the current version*. Index.html is the previous version - it relies on old-main.js and old-flappy.js. There's a bug with the flip cards I can't see how to solve...
